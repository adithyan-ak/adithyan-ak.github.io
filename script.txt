I'm Adithyan and I'm an Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) and a Certified Ethical Hacker (Master). I practice and preach Offensive Security. My area of expertise includes Open Source Intelligence, Application, and Network Security. I actively research Exploit Development and Malware Analysis. I have been a learner in the field of Information Security for more than 7 years now. 

I write a <a href="https://adithyanak.medium.com" target="_blank">blog</a> and establish my findings there as a contribution to the InfoSec community

I develop some cool projects occasionally which you can find on my <a href="https://github.com/adithyan-ak" target="_blank">Github</a>.

My <a href="Resume.pdf" target="_blank">Resume</a> can shed light on who I am.
